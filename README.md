# CSP-based minesweeper agent
Authors
* Alice Nicoletta
* Gaetano Barresi
* Leonardo Cozzolino

## Hot to use 
To start a run with GUI, just this snippet of code in your terminal: 
```
!git clone https://github.com/tanobar/minesweeper_prj.git
%cd minesweeper_prj
!python main.py
```
Values for the grid size and number of mines can be changed on line 58 of the main.py script.
## Requirements
In order to pursue minimality, we decided to stick on python built-in modules.
No virtual environment, no external dependencies and no "it works on my machine" for this project.
We sacrificed performance and speed-ups in the name of simplicity and portability. 
## Features 
* GUI
* different options for the agent, for testing
